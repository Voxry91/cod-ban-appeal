# cod-ban-appeal

On the evening of August 19th, 2024, I wanted to play a few rounds of Battle Royale with my friends. We had started downloading the game the night before. Once in the game, it took an unusually long time to find a 4-player Battle Royale match. We tried the Plunder mode, which worked without any issues and found a match right away. After that, we tried the BR mode again and still couldn’t find a match. After some research on Reddit, we stumbled upon the possibility of a "Shadow Ban," including a link to the relevant page. We didn’t consider the possibility that one of us might have been banned - one person had never played COD before, and for the other three, including myself, it had been several months since we last played.
When prompted to log in to the site, I attempted to use my BattleNet email-address, where I had purchased Modern Warfare and Vanguard (dns.grim@gmail.com, BattleNet ID: Voxry#2977). The login failed, and I assumed I had forgotten my password. The site also offered a "Login via Steam" option, which I used instead of resetting my password. If I remember correctly, a prompt appeared asking me to enter a code sent to my email. The email displayed ended with "...@web.de," which puzzled me, as I hadn’t used my web.de email address in nearly a decade. I was very confused as to why this account seemed linked here. I followed the instructions and logged into my old email account (d_grimberg@web.de). There were no emails in the account (except for the code email from Activision), despite years of use. After successfully logging in with the code, I found that I apparently had a "Shadow Ban," preventing me from searching for Battle Royale games. We were all perplexed as to why this ban occurred and why an old email was associated with my account, which seemed to be used by Steam/Activision, even though I had been playing Call of Duty with my BattleNet account on Steam before. 
Since I suspected an error, that an old, incorrect, and for some reason banned account was linked to my Steam profile, I removed this link in the account settings.

My next step was to attempt to log into the account I had used previously without any issues on Battle Net (dns.grim@gmail.com). I used the ‘Password Reset’ option since none of my usual passwords worked. I managed to log into my account, the same one where I had purchased the games. In the account’s linked profiles, my Battle Net account was listed, and I could easily add my Steam account. Out of curiosity, I checked the ‘Shadow Ban’ page again and saw that no ban was in place. We then played a round of ‘3-player Battle Royale’ and went to bed. The next morning (at 09:09 AM), I received an email stating that my account had been permanently banned. My old, incorrect account (@web.de) was also apparently permanently banned at the same time.
The stated reason for the ban is "Use of unauthorized software and manipulation of game data," which I simply cannot understand. I am 33 years old, and I have been actively using my Steam and BattleNet accounts for over 20 years to play various competitive FPS games. I have never cheated, used unauthorized software, or manipulated game data in Call of Duty or any other competitive games in the past or present.
The only programs running on my PC at the time were Steam, Firefox, Logitech Gaming Software, Nvidia Settings, Teamspeak 3, Google Drive, possibly OBS (though I’m not sure), and, of course, Call of Duty itself. My operating system is Windows 10 Pro, and the only hardware component I have changed since the last time I played Call of Duty is a CPU cooler. I cannot understand or explain what software I might have used or what game data I could have manipulated.
A check of my old email address (d_grimberg@web.de) on https://haveibeenpwned.com/ unfortunately revealed that this email address appears to be compromised. As a security measure, since I cannot be sure that no one has gained access to my accounts and, to be honest since I do not fully understand what is happening here, I have changed the passwords for all active accounts, added my phone number to Activision, and enabled two-factor authentication.
